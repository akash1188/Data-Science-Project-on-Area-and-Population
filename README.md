# Data-Science-Project-on-Area-and-Population
In this project, we aim to visually represent the area and populations of various cities in California using point sizes as indicators. To provide context for the point sizes, we'll include a legend that delineates the scale of these sizes. This will be achieved by plotting labeled data points, even though they have no actual entries.
